#Intro
This repo is intended for CS290I (Computer Science for Non_Computer Science) students. It contains sample skeleton code from HW_1. An easy way to start the homework would be to fork this repo. 

## Outcomes
By the end of this HW you will be familiar with the basic storyboarding principles of iOS development. You will be able to create static views with pre-defined segues from xCode’s storyboard editor. You will get introduced UITableViewController, UIViewController and basic layout-ing via springs and struts.
## Statement

Page 1: A UIViewController with buttons segueing  to different app sections
Pages 2 - 5: These represent different section of the app, you can fill them with any content from your resume (for example: about me, work experience and education, contact information,… ) You are required that at least one of your sections to be a static UITableViewController with more than one section. You are also required to use push segues only for segueing.
